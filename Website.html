      He heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower
      density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft,
      hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The envelope does not
      have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at
      about the same pressure as the surrounding air.

      The French brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Ã‰tienne Montgolfier
      developed a hot-air balloon in Annonay, Ardeche, France, and demonstrated
      it publicly on September 19, 1783, making an unmanned flight lasting 10
      minutes. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with
      animals, the first balloon flight with humans aboard, a tethered flight,
      performed on or around October 15, 1783, by Jean-Francois Pilatre de
      Rozier, who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the
      Reveillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Later that same day,
      Pilatre de Rozier became the second human to ascend into the air, reaching
      an altitude of 26 m (85 ft), the length of the tether.

      A hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered, fabric gas bag
      (lifting "envelope"), with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or
      throat. Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for carrying the
      passengers. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the
      "burner", which injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within.
      The heater or burner is fueled by propane, a liquefied gas stored in
      pressure vessels, similar to high-pressure forklift cylinders.[23][24]n
      older, and presently less commonly used, style of top vent is called a
      "Velcro-style" vent. This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the
      balloon. However, rather than having a set of "vent lines" that can
      repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by "hook and loop"
      fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight.
      Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second
      "maneuvering vent" built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the
      balloon. Another common type of top design is the "smart vent", which,
      rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the "parachute"
      type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening.
